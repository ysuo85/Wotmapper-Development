#Wotmapper with door script
This is an improved version of wotmapper v2.2 with the following
features and fixes:
- A door script that automatically sets doors when map is loaded. Or you
can manually set them the old fashioned way.
- Fixed package file so when it's loaded, it does not show three
separate packages.

To-do:(for now)
Brief mode map-follow.
Reformat the mapper into a Mudlet module.
Find the most up-to-date WoTMUD map.
